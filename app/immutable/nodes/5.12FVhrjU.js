        Users can now speak commands instead of tapping through multiple
        screens. The system interprets, clarifies, and executes actions, making
        the workflow faster and easier.</p> <p>Built in just two weeks, the service is designed to plug into any mobile
        app with minimal effort.</p></div> <h2>Context</h2> <p>We recently worked on a project to make an existing asset management
      mobile app voice-enabled. The goal was simple: allow users to dictate
      instructions instead of navigating through multiple taps, forms, and
      menus.</p> <p>This matters because in apps where completing a task involves several
      steps, reducing friction improves efficiency and usability.</p> <img alt="Action Bot Screenshot" style="max-width:100%; height:auto; margin: 1em 0;"> <h2>Approach</h2> We built a GenAI-powered service that can: <ul><li>Understand spoken user commands</li> <li>Ask clarifying questions if needed</li> <li>Confirm the action</li> <li>Generate structured responses that the mobile app can execute</li></ul> <p>The service was designed as a plug-in component. As long as the target app
      defines its possible actions and response structure, the voice layer can
      be integrated with minimal changes.</p> <img alt="Action Bot Screenshot" style="max-width:100%; height:auto; margin: 1em 0;"> <h2>Outcome</h2> <ul><li><b>Time to delivery:</b> 3 weeks (from idea to user-testing release)</li> <li><b>Ease of integration:</b> The service is portable across mobile applications</li> <li><b>User experience:</b> Tasks that previously took multiple taps can now
        be performed with a single spoken instruction</li></ul> <h2>Demo</h2> <div style="text-align: center;"><video controls style="width:400px; height:auto; border:1px solid #ccc; border-radius:8px"></video></div></div></article>`,2);function j(u,g){b(g,!1);const o=new Date("2025-08-10"),v=o.toLocaleDateString("en-US",{year:"numeric",month:"long",day:"numeric"});S();var s=C(),n=t(s),r=e(t(n),2),l=e(t(r));l.textContent=v,_(2),a(r),a(n);var p=e(n,2),c=e(t(p),8);i(c,"src",T);var m=e(c,8);i(m,"src",U);var d=e(m,8),h=t(d);i(h,"src",I),h.muted=!0,a(d),a(p),a(s),y(f=>i(l,"datetime",f),[()=>o.toISOString()],A),k(u,s),x()}export{j as component};
