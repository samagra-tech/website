        understanding to extract structured data from delivery slips of varying
        layouts. The system enriches raw text with organizational context and
        outputs machine-ready data, cutting down manual effort significantly.</p></div> <h2>Context</h2> <p>GenAI has touched almost every domain; code generation, automation,
      marketing campaigns, video synthesis, even virtual photo shoots. Our
      recent work explored another use case: extracting structured information
      from physical documents.</p> <p>Traditional OCR (Optical Character Recognition) tools are good at scanning
      text but weak in context. They struggle with images that have inconsistent
      table layouts, or product brochures with decorative fonts and non-linear
      design.</p> <p>Our client faced exactly this challenge with delivery slips received from
      multiple vendors. Each slip followed a different layout, some
      straightforward, others confusing. The need was clear: reliable extraction
      of key fields in a structured format that downstream systems could
      directly use.</p> <img alt="Action Bot Screenshot" style="max-width:100%; height:auto; margin: 1em 0;"> <h2>Approach</h2> <p>We designed a service that combines OCR extraction with GenAI-based
      contextual enrichment.</p> <ol><li>OCR identifies and extracts raw text.</li> <li>GenAI interprets the extracted text in the organization’s context (e.g.,
        mapping “vendor code” across multiple layouts).</li> <li>When needed, the system enriches fields with information from other
        sources.</li> <li>Output is returned in a structured, machine-readable format for users or
        downstream systems.</li></ol> <h2>Key Considerations</h2> <p>Building a production-ready solution required attention beyond the core
      workflow:</p> <ol><li><strong>Data Privacy</strong><br> The client’s concern about sensitive commercial data was addressed by hosting
        an open-source LLM in their own GPU instance. All processing stayed within
        their environment.</li> <li><strong>Accuracy</strong><br> The system was able to correctly associate about 95% of the required fields
        with the right data from the scanned delivery slips.</li> <li><strong>Performance</strong><br> The service was tuned to deliver responses quickly enough to integrate seamlessly
        into operational workflows.</li> <li><strong>Integration</strong><br> Output was designed in a structured format that downstream systems could
        consume without additional transformation.</li></ol> <h2>Outcome</h2> <p>The pilot showed that combining OCR with GenAI can reliably process messy
      documents, achieving 95% correct field associations and significantly
      reducing manual effort, while meeting the client’s privacy and performance
      requirements.</p> <ul><li><strong>Build time:</strong> 1 month from design to deployment</li> <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> ~95% in pilot tests</li> <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Reduced manual data entry effort and enabled faster
        downstream processing</li> <li><strong>Adoption:</strong> Pilot users satisfied with progress and eager
        for broader rollout</li></ul></div></article>`);function D(m,h){f(h,!1);const o=new Date("2025-09-06"),u=o.toLocaleDateString("en-US",{year:"numeric",month:"long",day:"numeric"});A();var i=C(),r=t(i),n=e(t(r),2),s=e(t(n));s.textContent=u,c(2),a(n),a(r);var l=e(r,2),p=e(t(l),10);d(p,"src",O),c(18),a(l),a(i),w(g=>d(s,"datetime",g),[()=>o.toISOString()],x),v(m,i),b()}export{D as component};
